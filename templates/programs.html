    <h2>Our Programs</h2>
    <p>Every year, Filipino high school graduates who are incoming first-year college students apply to the CHED Scholarship Program. This program offers financial aid to students enrolled in higher education institutions, promoting accessible education, particularly for disadvantaged and deserving individuals. As a result, many applicants compete for this scholarship opportunity. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Scholarship Application Database is a project by a group of second-year Computer Science students at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines. 
    <br>
    The project aims to extend a thorough database management system designed specifically for the CHED scholarship application process. While the students acknowledge the availability of existing database systems for CHED, their main objective is to utilize this project to grasp concepts and enhance their database management skills. The project involves developing the application "Isko ni Kapitan," which allows users to conduct CRUD actions, where users can create, update, delete, and view the records through the application interface</p>
